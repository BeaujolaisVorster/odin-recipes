    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Imagine the best French toast you've ever had combined with the best ham and cheese sandwich you've ever had, topped with perfectly poached eggs, and you have Chef John's Monte Cristo Benedict recipe. You don't need any Hollandaise because the poached egg yolks are the sauce.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 tbsp white sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon ground allspice</li>
        <li>1 pinch kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne peppe</li>
        <li>4 thick slices day-old french bread</li>
        <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>8 thin slices cooked ham</li>
        <li>4 slices cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>4 slices havarti cheese</li>
        <li>8 poached eggs</li>
        <li>fresh chopped chives to top</li>
        <li>1 pinch kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <br><br>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <br>
        <li>Whisk 2 eggs, cream, sugar, cinnamon, allspice, 1 pinch salt, and 1 pinch cayenne pepper together in a bowl until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Lay bread slices, one at a time, into egg mixture; let bread absorb mixture. Flip bread slices; let bread absorb mixture until almost all mixture has been absorbed, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat; add butter and let melt. Add bread slices; cook until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer French toast to a baking sheet.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add ham slices to the skillet; cook until begins to brown, about 1 minute per side.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Place 1 slice Cheddar cheese on 1 slice French toast, top with 2 slices ham, and top ham with 1 slice Havarti cheese. Repeat with remaining Cheddar cheese, French toast, ham, and Havarti cheese.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until French toast slices are no longer wet, batter is set, and cheeses have melted and begun to brown, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Place sandwiches on serving plates; top each with 2 poached eggs and chives. Season with 1 pinch salt and 1 pinch cayenne pepper.</li>
    </ol>
